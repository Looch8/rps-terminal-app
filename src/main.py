# ROCK PAPER SCISSORS

# Modules
import random  # for getting random computer choice
import csv  # for reading and writing scores to csv file
import sys  # provide info on functions
import unittest  # for testing

# Function imports
from game_functions import get_player_choice, get_computer_choice


print(get_player_choice())
print(get_computer_choice())
# User choice
# player_selection = input('rock, paper, or scissors? ').lower()


# # calling comp function to randomize computer choice
# computer_selection = get_computer_choice()
# print(play_round(get_player_choice, computer_selection))

# Function that keeps score (first to 5 wins) and prints winner to the console
# Ability to reset game at any point in time during the game
# Function to reset game and start again once a winner is announced
# score function in file that updates with each round (thanks for suggestion, Simon)


# Hardware requirements just has to be "what hardware you tested it on"

# for best marks, must use 4+ imported packages (csv, colored, etc)
#   N.B. this does NOT include importing your own functions. You need 5 of these as well.

# Include a script file to run application, like we did in Week 8 Day 3 class (around 2.5 hours in iirc)

# MULTIPLE bash scripts required. Suggested: one to check python, one to check packages, one to check all files available, one to run the program

# MINIMUM 20 commits. Will only get 2/6 marks if you have less than 20. Cannot be all in one day (RIP procrastina

# A couple of my notes:
# Project management platforms: trello, monday.com, meistertask
# Testing: can be automatic (using pytest for example) or manual (using a spreadsheet)
